NOTES FROM THE DEVELOPER

`/minecraft_a` contains the original problem/domain PDDL pair for a problem found at the assessment-outlined repo. 
The original problem file can be found here: https://github.com/tomsilver/pddlgym/blob/master/pddlgym/pddl/minecraft/problem0.pddl


`/minecraft_b` contains the modified problem/domain PDDL pair for the same problem. I interpreted the original `craftplanks` action literals as an intended
representation of a specific goal-state, which is reflected in the problem definition. I thoroughly simplified the problem complexity for testing, manageability,
and demonstrative purposes.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

`minecraft_domain_b.pddl` and `minecraft_problem_b.pddl` are the domain and problem files, respectively. The domain file contains the action definitions, predicates, types, 
etc., and the problem file contains the initial state and goal state definitions.

The solution output is included for 3 different configurations:

`/scenario_a_0_BFWSFFparser` - Original scenario, original solver

`/scenario_a_1_LAMAfirstsatisficingplanner` - Original scenario, alternate solver

`/scenario_b_0_BFWSFFparser` - Alternate scenario (see the comment-toggle in the problem file), original solver

Each contains a log and a plan file. Both are basic .txt files. The log documents the solver's output, the plan contains the corresponding action sequence.

If you would like to test the solution, I recommend visiting https://editor.planning.domains/# and running the files there. It's a free editor you can run in the browser,
and it contains the necessary + additional solvers to replicate/tweak output.
