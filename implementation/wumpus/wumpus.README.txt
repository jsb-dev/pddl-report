NOTES FROM THE DEVELOPER

`/wumpus_a` contains the original problem/domain PDDL pair provided with the assessment criteria.


`/wumpus_b` contains the modified problem/domain PDDL pair for the Wumpus world problem, where I performed a similar analysis.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

`wumpus_domain_b.pddl` and `wumpus_problem_b.pddl` are the domain and problem files. I treated the lethal scenario as the default scenario to help with managing the project.
The analysis includes alternating scenarios with LAMA-first as the recurring solver.

`/lethal_scenario_a_0_LAMAfirstsatisficingplanner` - Original scenario, original solver

`/nonlethal_scenario_b_0_LAMAfirstsatisficingplanner` - Alternate scenario, original solver

`/nonlethal_scenario_b_1_BFWSFFparser` - Alternate scenario (see the comment-toggle in the problem file), alternate solver

Each contains a log and a plan file. Both are basic .txt files. The log documents the solver's output, the plan contains the corresponding action sequence.

If you would like to test the solution, I recommend visiting https://editor.planning.domains/# and running the files there.
